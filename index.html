<p>Reverse engineered SystemVerilog RTL version of the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YMF262">Yamaha OPL3 (YMF262)</a> FM Synthesizer.
Design is complete and working on the Digilent ZYBO board. The software needs a bit of cleaning up.</p>

<p>Hear it in action:</p>

</ul>

<p>Every effort possible has been made to replicate, bit-true, the math of the original OPL3 chip. Several other very smart people put in a lot of work before me to get as close as possible this goal in software, and this FPGA design would not be possible without their work. Their efforts included <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18IGx18NQY_Q1PJVZ-bHywao9bhsDoAqoIn1rIm42nwo/edit">de-lidding the chip to extract the actual values out of the ROMs</a>. They're all over at <a href="http://forums.submarine.org.uk/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=9">http://forums.submarine.org.uk/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=9</a>. You can follow the progression of some of the reverse engineering--it's quite interesting.</p>

<p>There are some differences between this version and the original chip in the external interface due to the hardware on
the board that I'm using. The design is targeted to the <a href="https://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?Prod=ZYBO">Digilent ZYBO board</a>
which has the <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-7000.html">Xilinx Zynq-7000
SoC</a> containing an ARM dual-core Cortex-A9 and an FPGA. The board also has an 
<a href="http://www.analog.com/en/products/audio-video/audio-codecs/ssm2603.html#product-overview">Analog Devices SSM2603
audio codec</a> with dual 24-bit DACs. The interface to the CPU is AXI4-Lite
and the interface to the DAC is I<sup>2</sup>S, matching the particular hardware I have to work with. These
interfaces are wrapped in the design and would be easy to swap out.</p>

<p>The original OPL3 chip used a 14.31818MHz master clock. The sample rate was 14.31818MHz/288 = 49.7159KHz, which is quite an interesting sample rate. With 36 operator slots, that gives 8 clocks to update each operator each sample (operator logic is
time-shared between slots).</p>

<p>The SSM2603 on the ZYBO uses 256x oversampling, and thus requires a master clock 256x the sample clock.
I decided to use a single clock domain and keep the sample clock as close as possible to the original
chip. The ZYBO provides the FPGA with an external clock of 125MHz. Using a mixed-mode clock manager (MMCM) in the FPGA,
I'm able to synthesize a 12.727MHz clock from that, which divided by 256 gets me very close to the original
sample rate at 49.7148KHz. Updating 36 operator slots using my slower master clock only gives me 7 clock
cycles per sample instead of 8, but that's okay because I can stack tons of combinational logic up with
few pipeline registers with this slow clock speed and modern FPGA. The build meets timing with 53.1ns of slack (＠_＠;)</p>

<p>As far as software, so far I've ported over <a href="http://software.kvee.cz/imfplay/">imfplay</a> from x86 DOS to the ARM running bare metal. It can playback .dro files captured in DOSBox while playing the original games. They are essentially OPL3 register writes using a 1000Hz timer tick (I used the built in timer in the ARM). The files are stored in an in-memory filesystem. The whole package including the FPGA bitstream, front stage boot loader, imfplay executable, and filesystem image can be built using one command and placed on an SD card.</p>

<p>In doing the project, I was very impressed with what the original chip designers were able to accomplish. They used some very clever techniques to squeeze maximum functionality out of very limited resources--particularly using the combination of an exponential lookup table and a log-sine lookup table to <a href="https://github.com/gtaylormb/opl3_fpga/blob/master/docs/opl3math/opl3math.pdf">apply gain to the sine wave without the use of multipliers</a>, and the clever use of time sharing the operator resources among 36 slots.</p>

<p>Tools used are Modelsim, Vivado 2015.1, Octave (for sample analysis), and SVEditor (for SystemVerilog file editing).</p>

<p>These were produced by writing the actual binary output values of the operator logic in simulation to a file and plotting them using Octave.</p>

<a id="future-work" class="anchor" href="#future-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future work</h2>

<p>I'd really love to make the board appear as a USB peripheral when plugged into PC. If DOSBox/ScummVM could be made aware of the device, they could direct all OPL3 writes to the board. Digital PCM output could be made available as well.</p>

<p>Another idea is to port DOSBox/ScummVM directly to the ARM CPU on the board.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have other ideas or are interested into doing either of these projects, I'll help out as much as I can.</p>
